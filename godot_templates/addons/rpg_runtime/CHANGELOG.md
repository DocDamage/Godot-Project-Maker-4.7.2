# Changelog

## 0.3.0

* Action-RPG archetype (`archetypes/arpg/`): hitboxes that are live only on attack frames, hurtboxes
  with invulnerability windows, health, knockback and crits; the player's combat state machine
  (idle, move, attack with an input buffer, hurt, dodge, dead); enemies with a component-based AI
  (detection with line of sight, chase, wander, telegraphed attacks, loot pickups); the HUD; the
  generic swing effect for characters without attack animations; optional tile-based navigation.
* Shared code: `RpgActor` gained `move_locked`, `facing_locked` and `animation_locked` (set by an
  archetype's combat code), `RpgAnimationDriver` gained `has_animation` / `play_exact`, the
  inventory menu has an extension point for archetype buttons, and boot takes the archetype's HUD.
## 0.2.0

* Turn-based archetype (`archetypes/turn_based/`): battle commands (attack, defend, item, skill
  placeholder, run), the battle controller and turn manager, the battle scene and interface,
  overworld enemies that start encounters, and the combat mode that returns the result to the map.
* A defeated enemy stays defeated across saves; escaping gives a short grace period; losing sends
  the player back to the newest save, or to the map's default spawn with full health.

## 0.1.0

* First release of the shared RPG runtime: events bus, game state, scene routing, saving,
  stats, items, inventory, dialogue, interaction, settings, audio, UI and translation-ready text.
